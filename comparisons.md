# My personal comparison

## Shells:

- Fish: Nice autocomplete, similar enough to posix to be used daily
- Nu: fun, modern, but very different, hard to switch to on linux. Ok on windows. Also so changes in the syntax break the configuration file, error messages are helpfull to identify the change, but nonetheless you have to fix them right away.
- Osh: TBD
- Brush: TBD

Terminals:
- Ghostty: fast, ready to use, easy to configure. Not available on windows yet. My current favorite on linux.
- Rio: ok, some stuff missing like resizable panes. My current favorite on windows.
- Wezterm: very configurable with lua, a bit slow to start. I have a weird bug that create a new line each type I type a letter. Probably something in my config.
