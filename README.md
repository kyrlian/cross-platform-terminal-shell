## Intro

I use MacOS for work, and windows at home, my original setup is mostly the default on each:

- On MacOS: [Iterm2](https://iterm2.com/) with [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) and [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki). I also occasionally use [fish](https://fishshell.com/).
- On Windows: [Windows Terminal](https://aka.ms/terminal) with [Nushell](https://www.nushell.sh/), and [wsl Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/desktop/wsl).

[VS code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) being my main IDE, and I use [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) on mac and WSL, and [scoop](https://scoop.sh/) on windows as package managers.

As I code more and more at home, and there is more and more cross plateform tools, I started to search for a set of tools I could use on both plateforms. Of course I ended-up with different configs!
