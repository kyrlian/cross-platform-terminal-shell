# Helix config

## Customize theme

Run helix, and open the config with `:config-open`

Type `:theme ` (note the space after 'theme') to display available themes. Type <Tab> to cycle the themes.

Once you find one you like add theme = "your theme" in the config, and save.

```sh
theme = "doom_acario_dark"
```
